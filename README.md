<h1> BondSpace : AI-Powered Personalized Roommate Matching for Women’s Co-Living Spaces</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This MERN stack-based platform offers an ethical, scalable, and voice-driven roommate matching solution designed exclusively for women’s co-living spaces. Leveraging Omnidim.io Voice AI, it conducts a conversational micro-survey to capture core compatibility traits, then uses an explainable AI matching engine to recommend compatible roommates and best-fit rooms. The system emphasizes privacy, fairness, and transparency with features such as a re-match with voice feedback and an admin dashboard for oversight.
